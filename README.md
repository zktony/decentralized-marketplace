# Decentralized Marketplace for NGOs

## About the Project 🚀

The aim of this project is to create a decentralized marketplace for NGOs, where they can purchase different items using the funds provided by donors. The main objectives of this project are to promote transparency and accountability in the use of donated funds and to provide a secure, decentralized platform for NGOs to purchase goods from sellers.

The marketplace will be built on a public blockchain, and the only currency that will be used for transactions will be the platform's native currency. This will ensure that all transactions are transparent and visible on the blockchain, making it easy for donors to track where their funds are being used.

The project will have three main actors: donors, NGOs, and sellers. Donors will be able to contribute funds in the form of the platform's native currency, which they can then allocate to different NGOs. NGOs will be able to use these funds to purchase different items from sellers, who will be able to sell their goods and services on the platform in exchange for the native currency.

The marketplace will have a user-friendly interface that will allow NGOs to easily find and purchase the items they need. The platform will also have robust security measures in place to ensure that all transactions are secure and that the funds allocated to each NGO are only used for their intended purpose.

Overall, this decentralized marketplace for NGOs will provide a transparent, secure, and decentralized platform for NGOs to purchase the items they need, while also providing donors with full visibility into how their funds are being used.

## Flagship Features
- It allows donors to donate tokens directly from other Parachains in their native token. Our Parachain then uses an Automated Market Maker (AMM) to convert these tokens to our native token, which can later be converted into Purpose-based Tokens (PBT).
